While playing around with Duolingo one day, I randomly noticed how nice their button press feels. So out of curiosity, I decided to try recreating it with pure CSS. In this blog, I’ll share two different ways I tried to get that effect.

You can check out the working demo on CodePen here 👉 Duolingo Button Press Effect in CSS. Feel free to play with it while you read through the steps below.
Method 1: Button With Bottom Border

This method creates the illusion of depth by adding a solid border-bottom, then removing it when the button is pressed.

.button-1 {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #1CB0F6;
  font-weight: 800;
  height: 44px;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 15px;
  border: none;
  border-bottom: 4px solid #BBE7FC;
}

.button-1:active {
  transform: translateY(2px);
  border-bottom: 0;
}

This method achieves a similar visual to Duolingo’s button, but the press effect doesn’t quite match the feel of the real app’s interaction. So, I kept exploring…
Method 2: Button With Box Shadow

Then, I came across a YouTube video that share a technique much closer to Duolingo’s actual button feel. I tried the approach, and it really create the soft press effect!

It uses box-shadow to make the button look slightly raised, and when you press it, the shadow disappears which makes it feel like the button is actually being pushed down.

.button-2 {
  background: #fff;
  font-weight: 800;
  color: #1CB0F6;
  height: 44px;
  cursor: pointer;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 15px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 0 #BBE7FC;
}

.button-2:active {
  box-shadow: none;
  transform: translateY(4px);
}

This method feels much closer to how Duolingo’s button really works, soft, simple, and kind of satisfying to click, without needing any borders.
Bonus: Another Button Style You’ll Find in Duolingo

This type of button works well on white or neutral backgrounds. It adds light hover and active styles to give feedback even without vibrant colours.

.button-3 {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #4B4B4B;
  border-radius: 15px;
  border: 2px solid #E5E5E5;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 0 #E5E5E5;
  font-weight: 800;
  height: 44px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.button-3:hover {
  background-color: #E5E5E5;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 0 #CECECE;
  border: 2px solid #CECECE;
}

.button-3:active {
  box-shadow: none;
  transform: translateY(2px);
  background-color: #E5E5E5;
  border: 2px solid #CECECE;
}

Final Thoughts

That’s it! Between the two methods, the box-shadow method more closely replicates the actual Duolingo button.
Why box-shadow feels more like Duolingo:

The box-shadow makes the button look slightly raised, like it’s floating. When you press it, the shadow disappears which feels like you’re actually pushing the button down. It is smooth, clean, and gives that soft, tactile feedback.

Compared to the border-bottom trick, which can cause tiny layout shifts when pressed, the shadow method just feels nicer and more natural.
